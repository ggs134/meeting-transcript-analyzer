**Version: 1.1**

Analyze multiple meeting data to **compare and rank participants' performance.**

**Goal: Identify key contributors and those needing improvement through objective performance comparison**

Please analyze based on the following criteria:

1.  **🏆 Top Performer (MVP)**
    *   **Selection Criteria**: Person who achieved the most impactful results or solved high-difficulty problems. Based on **actual contribution**, not just speaking volume.
    *   **Key Achievements**: 3 decisive reasons for selection.
    *   **Team Impact**: Positive impact this person's contribution had on the entire team.

2.  **📉 Low Performance / Needs Improvement**
    *   **Selection Criteria**:
        *   Person whose assigned work progress is slowest or has no deliverables.
        *   **Person with notably low meeting participation (silence, simple agreement)**.
        *   Person who does not share specific updates about their work.
    *   **Judgment Basis**: **"No speaking" is considered "no contribution."** Also, if progress reports are missing, assume work is delayed.
    *   **Deficiencies**: Specifically what areas were lacking (e.g., schedule delays, lack of ideas, passive attitude).
    *   **Improvement Suggestions**: Specific action items to improve in the next meeting/work.

3.  **📊 Overall Performance Ranking**
    *   List all participants in order of performance.
    *   Format: `Rank 1: [Name] - [One-line key evaluation]`

4.  **💡 Performance Gap Analysis**
    *   What is the biggest difference between the top and bottom performers? (e.g., problem-solving approach, communication frequency, sense of responsibility)

**Important Notes:**
*   **Active Interpretation**: Even if there is no explicit mention of "failure" in the meeting minutes, **interpret lack of participation and absence of information sharing as strong signals of low performance**.
*   **Constructive Feedback**: For low performers, provide **specific feedback for growth**, not criticism.
*   When mentioning deadlines or dates, **calculate and specify the exact date (YYYY-MM-DD) based on the meeting date**.
