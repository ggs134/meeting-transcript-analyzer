**Version: 2.0**

Analyze multiple meeting data to **compare and rank participants' performance using objective and clear criteria.**

**Goal: Identify key contributors and those needing improvement through objective performance comparison combining quantitative metrics and qualitative assessment**

## 📋 Evaluation Criteria and Methodology

### Step 1: Quantitative Metrics Analysis

First, calculate and analyze the following quantitative metrics:

**A. Participation Metrics**
- **Total Speak Count**: Total number of statements across all meetings
- **Total Words**: Total word count across all meetings
- **Meeting Attendance**: Number of meetings actually attended
- **Average Speak Count per Meeting**: Total speak count ÷ meetings attended
- **Average Words per Meeting**: Total words ÷ meetings attended
- **Participation Rate**: (Individual total speak count ÷ Total statements) × 100%

**B. Engagement Pattern Metrics**
- **Participation Consistency**: Whether participation was evenly distributed across meetings or concentrated in specific meetings
- **Statement Distribution**: Whether statements were evenly distributed throughout meetings or concentrated in specific segments
- **Engagement Depth**: Simple agreement ("Yes", "Okay", "Right") vs. concrete contribution (questions, suggestions, solutions)

**Quantitative Metrics Interpretation:**
- **High Participation**: Average speak count ≥ 120% of overall average, OR participation rate ≥ 15%
- **Medium Participation**: Average speak count 80-120% of overall average, OR participation rate 8-15%
- **Low Participation**: Average speak count < 80% of overall average, OR participation rate < 8%

### Step 2: Qualitative Assessment

Based on quantitative metrics, evaluate the following qualitative elements:

**A. Contribution Quality**
- **Problem-Solving Ability**: Did they solve specific problems or propose solutions?
- **Decision-Making Contribution**: Did they influence important decisions?
- **Idea Generation**: Did they propose new ideas or improvements?
- **Technical Expertise**: Did they solve technical challenges or share specialized knowledge?

**B. Accountability & Execution**
- **Work Progress**: Did they share specific progress on assigned tasks?
- **Commitment Fulfillment**: Did they fulfill commitments from previous meetings?
- **Schedule Adherence**: Did they meet deadlines, or clearly explain delays?

**C. Communication & Collaboration**
- **Clear Communication**: Did they convey opinions clearly and concretely?
- **Team Collaboration**: Did they listen to other team members and respond constructively?
- **Information Sharing**: Did they actively share necessary information?

**D. Leadership & Impact**
- **Meeting Facilitation**: Did they lead meetings or raise important topics?
- **Team Motivation**: Did they encourage or motivate team members?
- **Strategic Thinking**: Did they provide long-term perspectives or strategic proposals?

### Step 3: Comprehensive Evaluation and Ranking

**Weighting System:**
- **Quantitative Metrics (40%)**: Participation rate, speak ratio, participation consistency
- **Contribution Quality (30%)**: Problem-solving, decision-making contribution, idea generation
- **Accountability & Execution (20%)**: Work progress, commitment fulfillment, schedule adherence
- **Communication & Collaboration (10%)**: Communication, team collaboration, information sharing

**Ranking Calculation Method:**
1. Evaluate each participant in the 4 areas above on a 0-100 scale
2. Apply weights to calculate comprehensive score
3. Rank by comprehensive score
4. For ties, rank by contribution quality score

## ⚠️ Important Guidelines

1. **Objectivity First**: All evaluations must be based on actual meeting transcript content and quantitative metrics. Avoid speculation or assumptions.

2. **Data-Driven Judgment**: 
   - First check quantitative metrics such as speak count and word count.
   - If quantitative metrics are low, reflect this in qualitative assessment as well.
   - However, even if quantitative metrics are low, reflect special contributions (e.g., solving critical problems) if confirmed in transcripts.

3. **Active Interpretation**: 
   - Even if there is no explicit mention of "failure" in meeting minutes, **interpret lack of participation and absence of information sharing as strong signals of low performance**.
   - Consider participants with few statements as having low contribution.

4. **Constructive Feedback**: 
   - For low performers, provide **specific feedback for growth**, not criticism.
   - Write improvement suggestions in actionable and concrete terms.

5. **Date Calculation**: 
   - When mentioning deadlines or dates, **calculate and specify the exact date (YYYY-MM-DD) based on the meeting date**.

6. **Clear Evidence**: 
   - Provide specific evidence for all evaluations and rankings.
   - Explain by quoting specific content from meeting transcripts.
